Tools that i USE for WSL - PARROT OS 7 - Microsoft - Linux - Windows 11 - KDE 6 - 2025

X410 - Xserver for windows 11 - So you have a Desktop.
Do you want to seamlessly use Linux GUI apps side by side with Windows
apps? Simply start X410 and adjust a few settings; your Linux GUI
apps then suddenly appear in Windows and you can use them like Windows 
apps! It doesn't matter where your Linux GUI apps are actually
running; it can be a full virtual machine, Docker container, WSL
(Windows Subsystem for Linux) or whatever. As long as your Linux GUI
apps support X-Window client protocols, you can use them in Windows.
You can even securely use your Linux GUI apps running in a far remote
server via any SSH client that supports X11 forwarding over the Internet.

for Linux (WSL) distributions, enabling installation, snapshots, version
control, and seamless integration with Windows tools.
