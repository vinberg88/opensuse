X410 - Xserver for windows 11 - So you have a Desktop.
Do you want to seamlessly use Linux GUI apps side by side with Windows
apps? Simply start X410 and adjust a few settings; your Linux GUI
apps then suddenly appear in Windows and you can use them like Windows 
apps! It doesn't matter where your Linux GUI apps are actually
running; it can be a full virtual machine, Docker container, WSL
(Windows Subsystem for Linux) or whatever. As long as your Linux GUI
apps support X-Window client protocols, you can use them in Windows.
You can even securely use your Linux GUI apps running in a far remote
server via any SSH client that supports X11 forwarding over the Internet.

About Cinnamon Desktop - https://www.fedoraproject.org/spins/cinnamon

Cinnamon is a Linux desktop which provides advanced innovative
features and a traditional user experience. The desktop layout
is similar to GNOME 2. The underlying technology is forked from
GNOME Shell. The emphasis is put on making users feel at home
and providing them with an easy to use and comfortable desktop
experience. Cinnamon is a popular desktop alternative to
GNOME 3 and this spin provides the option to quickly try and
install this desktop. Cinnamon is a popular, modern Linux
desktop environment developed by the Linux Mint team, offering
a traditional, user-friendly interface (like Windows or older
GNOME) with innovative features, modern effects, and extensive
customization through themes, applets, and extensions, making
it a favorite for users seeking a familiar yet powerful
experience on Unix-like system.

About Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

https://www.fedoraproject.org

Fedora Linux is one of the world's most respected,
influential, and innovative open-source operating
systems. It serves as a dynamic platform for 
hardware, clouds, and containers, enabling software
developers and community members to build tailored
solutions for their users. While the project is
sponsored by the technology giant Red Hat 
(now a subsidiary of IBM), it is governed and developed
independently by The Fedora Project—a global community
of volunteers and employed engineers working in unison.
Fedora Linux is the operating system for those who want
to stand on the frontline of technology. It is generally
not the choice for someone who wants to install a computer
once and forget about it for five years. It is the choice
for the developer, the engineer, and the enthusiast who
wants to experience the latest the open-source world
has to offer, backed by the resources of the world's
largest open-source company.
