you can update thousands of packages, rollback to last 
week’s snapshot, fast-forward again, and even preview upcoming
releases. Built from latest kernel releases, compiled with

About XFCE Desktop - https://www.xfce.org

Xfce is a lightweight, fast, and stable desktop
environment for Unix-like operating systems such
as Linux and BSD. It’s designed to be modular
and resource-efficient, making it an excellent
choice for systems where performance matters — or
where you just want a clean, classic desktop look
without unnecessary visual effects. The name “Xfce” 
originally stood for XForms Common Environment, but
today it’s just known as “Xfce,” pronounced
“eks-eff-see-ee.” . Xfce is a nice desktop.

About WSL for Windows 11 / 10 via GITHUB - MY PAGE - https://vinberg88.github.io

WSL is a feature built by Microsoft for Windows 10/11 that
lets you run a Linux environment directly on your Windows
machine—without the need to create a separate virtual
machine or dual-boot. You can install a Linux distribution
(e.g., Ubuntu, Debian, openSUSE) and use Linux command-line
tools, utilities, and applications side-by-side with your
Windows applications.
