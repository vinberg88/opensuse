An operating system is the set of basic programs and utilities that make 
your computer run. Debian uses the kernel Linux (the kernel is the core of an OS),
but most of the basic OS tools come from the GNU project. Thus we refer
to Debian as a Debian GNU/Linux operating system, giving credit to all its main
originators. Debian GNU/Linux provides much more than just the OS---a 
wide range of application software is included too. It comes with a total of 
over 118000 packages, precompiled software bundled up in a nice format 
for easy installation on your machine. https://www.debian.org

About Cinnamon desktop - Cinnamon is a free and open-source desktop
environment for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems, which was

to Gnome 2 with underlying technology forked from Gnome Shell. Cinnamon
makes users feel at home with an easy-to-use and comfortable desktop

Ubuntu is a complete Linux-based operating system, freely available with both community
and professional support. https://ubuntu.com
