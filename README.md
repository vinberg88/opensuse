X410 - Xserver for windows 11 - So you have a Console / Desktop TO See GNOME.
Do you want to seamlessly use Linux GUI apps side by side with Windows
apps? Simply start X410 and adjust a few settings; your Linux GUI
apps then suddenly appear in Windows and you can use them like Windows 
apps! It doesn't matter where your Linux GUI apps are actually
running; it can be a full virtual machine, Docker container, WSL
(Windows Subsystem for Linux) or whatever. As long as your Linux GUI
apps support X-Window client protocols, you can use them in Windows.
You can even securely use your Linux GUI apps running in a far remote
server via any SSH client that supports X11 forwarding over the Internet.

https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/ubuntu-desktop-25-10-the-questing-quokka-roadmap/61159

Ubuntu is an ancient African word meaning ‘humanity to others’.
It is often described as reminding us that ‘I am what I am
because of who we all are’. We bring the spirit of Ubuntu
to the world of computers and software. The Ubuntu 
distribution represents the best of what the world’s software
community has shared with the world. Canonical is the
publisher of Ubuntu. Members of the Canonical team lead
aspects of Ubuntu such as the kernel, default desktop,
foundations, security, OpenStack, and Kubernetes. 
The first official Ubuntu release — Version 4.10, codenamed
the ‘Warty Warthog’ — was launched in October 2004, and
sparked dramatic global interest as thousands of free
software enthusiasts and experts joined the Ubuntu community.
Ubuntu today has many flavours and dozens of specialised 
derivatives. There are also special editions for servers, OpenStack
clouds, and connected devices. All editions share common
infrastructure and software, making Ubuntu a unique single
platform that scales from consumer electronics to the desktop
and up into the cloud for enterprise computing.

About KDE 6 Plasma - https://kde.org

KDE Plasma is a modern, feature-rich desktop environment
for Linux-based operating systems. Known for its sleek
design, customizable interface, and extensive set of
applications, it is also open source, devoid
of ads, and makes protecting your privacy and
personal data a priority. The KDE Plasma Launcher lets
you quickly and easily launch applications, but it
can do much more -- convenient tasks like bookmarking
applications, searching for documents as you type, or
navigating to common places help you get straight
to the point. With a history of recently started programs
and opened files, you can return to where you left off.
It even remembers previously entered search terms so
you don't have to. Your Plasma desktop is very flexible and
can be configured just how you like it using the System Settings
app. Easily manage hardware, software, and workspaces all in
one place: Keyboard, Printer, Languages, Desktop Themes, Fonts, Networks.

installation and perpetual software upgrades. It is not generally
necessary to reinstall or upgrade your Arch Linux system from one
"version" to the next. By issuing one command, an Arch system is
kept up-to-date and on the bleeding edge.

apps then suddenly appear in Windows and you can use them like Windows 
apps! It doesn't matter where your Linux GUI apps are actually
running; it can be a full virtual machine, Docker container, WSL
(Windows Subsystem for Linux) or whatever. As long as your Linux GUI
apps support X-Window client protocols, you can use them in Windows.
You can even securely use your Linux GUI apps running in a far remote
server via any SSH client that supports X11 forwarding over the Internet.

About Ubuntu Plucky Puffin 25.04 - https://ubuntu.com - https://ubuntu.com/desktop/wsl

Ubuntu is an ancient African word meaning ‘humanity to others’.
It is often described as reminding us that ‘I am what I am
because of who we all are’. We bring the spirit of Ubuntu
to the world of computers and software. The Ubuntu 
distribution represents the best of what the world’s software
community has shared with the world. Canonical is the
publisher of Ubuntu. Members of the Canonical team lead
aspects of Ubuntu such as the kernel, default desktop,
foundations, security, OpenStack, and Kubernetes. 
The first official Ubuntu release — Version 4.10, codenamed
the ‘Warty Warthog’ — was launched in October 2004, and
sparked dramatic global interest as thousands of free
software enthusiasts and experts joined the Ubuntu community.
Ubuntu today has many flavours and dozens of specialised 
derivatives. There are also special editions for servers, OpenStack
clouds, and connected devices. All editions share common
infrastructure and software, making Ubuntu a unique single
platform that scales from consumer electronics to the desktop
and up into the cloud for enterprise computing.

and opened files, you can return to where you left off.
It even remembers previously entered search terms so
you don't have to. Your Plasma desktop is very flexible and
can be configured just how you like it using the System Settings
app. Easily manage hardware, software, and workspaces all in

About Centos 9 Stream - https://www.centos.org 

Extra Read - https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/linux/what-is-centos-stream

The CentOS Linux distribution is a stable, predictable,
manageable and reproducible platform derived from the
sources of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). We are now
looking to expand on that by creating the resources needed
by other communities to come together and be able to build
on the CentOS Linux platform. And today we start the process
by delivering a clear governance model, increased 
transparency and access. In the coming weeks we aim to 
publish our own roadmap that includes variants of
the core CentOS Linux. The CentOS Project is a 
community-driven free software effort focused around
the goal of providing a rich base platform for open 
source communities to build upon. We will provide a 
development framework for cloud providers, the hosting 
community, and scientific data processing, as a few examples.
We work with several ‘upstream’ communities to help them layer
and distribute their software more effectively on a 
platform they can rely on.

About Ubuntu 24.10 Oracular Oriole - https://documentation.ubuntu.com/wsl/en/latest - https://ubuntu.com/blog/tag/ubuntu-24-10

Ubuntu is an ancient African word meaning ‘humanity to others’.
It is often described as reminding us that ‘I am what I am
because of who we all are’. We bring the spirit of Ubuntu
to the world of computers and software. The Ubuntu 
distribution represents the best of what the world’s software
community has shared with the world. Canonical is the
publisher of Ubuntu. Members of the Canonical team lead
aspects of Ubuntu such as the kernel, default desktop,
foundations, security, OpenStack, and Kubernetes. 
The first official Ubuntu release — Version 4.10, codenamed
the ‘Warty Warthog’ — was launched in October 2004, and
sparked dramatic global interest as thousands of free
software enthusiasts and experts joined the Ubuntu community.
Ubuntu today has many flavours and dozens of specialised 
derivatives. There are also special editions for servers, OpenStack
clouds, and connected devices. All editions share common
infrastructure and software, making Ubuntu a unique single
platform that scales from consumer electronics to the desktop
and up into the cloud for enterprise computing.

About KDE 6 Plasma - https://kde.org

KDE Plasma is a modern, feature-rich desktop environment
for Linux-based operating systems. Known for its sleek
design, customizable interface, and extensive set of
applications, it is also open source, devoid
of ads, and makes protecting your privacy and
personal data a priority. The KDE Plasma Launcher lets
you quickly and easily launch applications, but it
can do much more -- convenient tasks like bookmarking
applications, searching for documents as you type, or
navigating to common places help you get straight
to the point. With a history of recently started programs
and opened files, you can return to where you left off.
It even remembers previously entered search terms so
you don't have to.

init system, script driven set-ups and that’s it! This provides
you with a simple, crystal-clear Linux environment without all
the noise. You can then add on top of that just the packages
you need for your project, so whether it’s building a home
PVR, or an iSCSI storage controller, a wafer-thin mail server
container, or a rock-solid embedded switch, nothing else will
get in the way.

About MATE Desktop for Alpine Linux - https://mate-desktop.org

The MATE Desktop Environment is the continuation
of GNOME 2. It provides an intuitive and 
attractive desktop environment using traditional

because of who we all are’. We bring the spirit of Ubuntu
to the world of computers and software. The Ubuntu 
distribution represents the best of what the world’s software
community has shared with the world. Canonical is the
publisher of Ubuntu. Members of the Canonical team lead
aspects of Ubuntu such as the kernel, default desktop,
foundations, security, OpenStack, and Kubernetes. 
The first official Ubuntu release — Version 4.10, codenamed
the ‘Warty Warthog’ — was launched in October 2004, and
sparked dramatic global interest as thousands of free
software enthusiasts and experts joined the Ubuntu community.
Ubuntu today has many flavours and dozens of specialised 
derivatives. There are also special editions for servers, OpenStack
clouds, and connected devices. All editions share common
infrastructure and software, making Ubuntu a unique single
platform that scales from consumer electronics to the desktop
and up into the cloud for enterprise computing.

About KDE 6 Plasma - https://kde.org

KDE Plasma is a modern, feature-rich desktop environment
for Linux-based operating systems. Known for its sleek
design, customizable interface, and extensive set of
applications, it is also open source, devoid
of ads, and makes protecting your privacy and
personal data a priority. The KDE Plasma Launcher lets
you quickly and easily launch applications, but it
can do much more -- convenient tasks like bookmarking
applications, searching for documents as you type, or
navigating to common places help you get straight
to the point. With a history of recently started programs
and opened files, you can return to where you left off.
It even remembers previously entered search terms so
you don't have to.

About Manjaro Linux - https://manjaro.org

Manjaro is a user-friendly Linux distribution based on the 
independently developed Arch operating system. Within the 
Linux community, Arch itself is renowned for being an 
exceptionally fast, powerful, and lightweight distribution
that provides access to the very latest cutting-edge and
bleeding-edge software. However, Arch is also aimed at more
experienced or technically-minded users. As such, it is
generally considered to be beyond the reach of those who
lack the technical expertise (or persistence) required to
use it Developed in Austria, France, and Germany, Manjaro
provides all the benefits of the Arch operating system
combined with a focus on user-friendliness and accessibility.
Manjaro follows Arch Linux and officially only offers a 
64-bit version. Manjaro is suitable for both newcomers as 
well as experienced Linux users. For newcomers, a user-friendly
installer is provided, and the system itself is designed to
work fully 'straight out of the box' with features including
like desktops.. - Manjaro is my favorite.

The CentOS Linux distribution is a stable, predictable,
manageable and reproducible platform derived from the
sources of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). We are now
looking to expand on that by creating the resources needed
by other communities to come together and be able to build
on the CentOS Linux platform. And today we start the process
by delivering a clear governance model, increased 
transparency and access. In the coming weeks we aim to 
publish our own roadmap that includes variants of
the core CentOS Linux. The CentOS Project is a 
community-driven free software effort focused around
the goal of providing a rich base platform for open 
source communities to build upon. We will provide a 
development framework for cloud providers, the hosting 
community, and scientific data processing, as a few examples.
We work with several ‘upstream’ communities to help them layer
and distribute their software more effectively on a 
platform they can rely on.

What is KDE - https://kde.org

Use Plasma to surf the web; keep in touch with colleagues, friends
and family; manage your files, enjoy music and videos; and get
creative and productive at work. Do it all in a beautiful environment
that adapts to your needs, and with the safety, privacy-protection and
peace of mind that the best Free Open Source Software has to offer.
Plasma is a Desktop =)

About Ubuntu - https://ubuntu.com/wsl

Ubuntu is an ancient African word meaning ‘humanity to others’.
It is often described as reminding us that ‘I am what I am
because of who we all are’. We bring the spirit of Ubuntu
to the world of computers and software. The Ubuntu 
distribution represents the best of what the world’s software
community has shared with the world. Canonical is the
publisher of Ubuntu. Members of the Canonical team lead
aspects of Ubuntu such as the kernel, default desktop,
foundations, security, OpenStack, and Kubernetes. 
The first official Ubuntu release — Version 4.10, codenamed
the ‘Warty Warthog’ — was launched in October 2004, and
sparked dramatic global interest as thousands of free
software enthusiasts and experts joined the Ubuntu community.
Ubuntu today has many flavours and dozens of specialised 
derivatives. There are also special editions for servers, OpenStack
clouds, and connected devices. All editions share common
infrastructure and software, making Ubuntu a unique single
platform that scales from consumer electronics to the desktop
and up into the cloud for enterprise computing.

About Lubuntu "lxqt" - https://lubuntu.me

Lubuntu is a complete Operating System that ships
the essential apps and services for daily use: 
office applications, PDF reader,  image editor, Music
and video players, etc. Lubuntu now ships the most
advanced desktop interface, using Qt Technologies
for rendering the widgets and the entire ecosystem
(from the installer to the smallest parts). Lubuntu 
is compatible with the majority of existing file 
formats, such as images, songs, films, spreadsheets, 
text documents, internet radio stations, and much more.
Everything works out of the box. But if you need more
(usually proprietary) codecs for exotic file formats,
you can always install the ubuntu-restricted-extras
package and enjoy all that content.

What is Cinnamon Desktop - https://projects.linuxmint.com/cinnamon

Cinnamon is a Linux desktop that provides advanced innovative
features and a traditional user experience. The desktop layout
is similar to Gnome 2 with underlying technology forked from
Gnome Shell. Cinnamon makes users feel at home with an 
easy-to-use and comfortable desktop experience.
The development of Cinnamon began by the Linux Mint
team as the result of the April 2011 release of 
GNOME 3, in which the conventional desktop metaphor
of GNOME 2 was discarded in favor of GNOME Shell.
Following several attempts to extend GNOME 3 so
that it would suit the Linux Mint design goals 
through "Mint GNOME Shell Extensions", the Linux
Mint team eventually forked several GNOME 3
components to build an independent desktop environment.
cinnamon-desktop is a set of utility libraries and 
settings used by other Cinnamon components.

What is Fedora RawHide - https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/releases/rawhide

Rawhide is the name given to the current development version
of Fedora Linux. It consists of a package repository called
rawhide and contains the latest build of all Fedora Linux 
packages updated on a daily basis. Each day, the build system 
attempts to create a full set of deliverables ,images and so on
and all that compose successfully are included in the 
Rawhide tree for that day.

Rawhide is sometimes called "development" or "main". Fedora RawHide is the future.

Fedora, also known as Fedora Linux, is a popular Open Source Linux-based
operating system (OS). Designed as a secure, general-purpose OS, Fedora
is developed on a six-month to eight-month release cycle under the Fedora
Project. Both the OS and the Fedora Project are financially sponsored
and supported by Red Hat. Fedora is a free and open source OS platform
for hardware, clouds and containers. Based on the Linux OS kernel
architecture, Fedora Linux is a user-friendly OS that enables users to
perform their tasks easily and efficiently with minimal friction. The name
Fedora refers to the characteristic fedora hat in Red Hat's Shadowman logo.

What is KDE plasma 6 - https://kde.org 

Use Plasma to surf the web; keep in touch with colleagues, friends
and family; manage your files, enjoy music and videos; and get
creative and productive at work. Do it all in a beautiful environment
that adapts to your needs, and with the safety, privacy-protection and
peace of mind that the best Free Open Source Software has to offer.
With Plasma 6, our technology stack has undergone two major 
upgrades: a transition to the latest version of our application 
framework, Qt, and a migration to the modern Linux graphics 
platform, Wayland. We have done our best to ensure that these 
changes are as smooth and unnoticeable to the users as possible, 
so when you install this update, you will see the same familiar 
desktop environment that you know and love. But these 
under-the-hood upgrades benefit Plasma's security, 
efficiency, and performance, and improve support for modern
hardware. Thus Plasma delivers an overall more reliable
user experience, while paving the way for many more
improvements in the future. Kde 6 Plasma is a good Desktop.

About Ubuntu 22.04 - https://ubuntu.com

Ubuntu is an ancient African word meaning ‘humanity to others’.
It is often described as reminding us that ‘I am what I am
because of who we all are’. We bring the spirit of Ubuntu to
the world of computers and software. The Ubuntu distribution
represents the best of what the world’s software Community
has shared with the world. Ubuntu was the first operating
system to commit to scheduled releases on a predictable
cadence, every six months, starting in October 2004. 
In 2006 we decided that every fourth release, made every
two years, would receive long-term support for large-scale
deployments. This is the origin of the term LTS for 
stable, maintained releases. Ubuntu is World Class!

About KDE 6 Plasma - https://kde.org

KDE Plasma is a modern, feature-rich desktop environment
for Linux-based operating systems. Known for its sleek
design, customizable interface, and extensive set of
applications, it is also open source, devoid
of ads, and makes protecting your privacy and
personal data a priority. The KDE Plasma Launcher lets
you quickly and easily launch applications, but it
can do much more -- convenient tasks like bookmarking
applications, searching for documents as you type, or
navigating to common places help you get straight
to the point. With a history of recently started programs
and opened files, you can return to where you left off.
It even remembers previously entered search terms so
you don't have to.

About KDE plasma - https://kde.org/plasma-desktop

KDE Plasma is a modern, feature-rich desktop environment 
for Linux-based operating systems. Known for its 
sleek design, customizable interface, and extensive 
set of applications, it is also open source, devoid of ads, and
makes protecting your privacy and personal data a priority.
The Plasma Launcher lets you quickly and easily launch 
applications, but it can do much more -- convenient tasks like
bookmarking applications, searching for documents as you type, or
navigating to common places help you get straight to the point.
With a history of recently started programs and opened 
files, you can return to where you left off. It even remembers
previously entered search terms so you don't have to.
Plasma is made to stay out of the way as it helps you get things
done. But under its light and intuitive surface, it's a
powerhouse. So you're free to choose ways of usage right
as you need them and when you need them. With KDE Plasma the user
is king.

About Debian: Debian is a free operating system (OS) for your computer. 
An operating system is the set of basic programs and utilities that make 
your computer run. Debian uses the kernel Linux (the kernel is the core of an OS),
but most of the basic OS tools come from the GNU project. Thus we refer
to Debian as a Debian GNU/Linux operating system, giving credit to all its main
originators. Debian GNU/Linux provides much more than just the OS---a 
wide range of application software is included too. It comes with a total of 
over 118000 packages, precompiled software bundled up in a nice format 
for easy installation on your machine. https://www.debian.org

About Cinnamon desktop - Cinnamon is a free and open-source desktop
environment for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems, which was

to Gnome 2 with underlying technology forked from Gnome Shell. Cinnamon
